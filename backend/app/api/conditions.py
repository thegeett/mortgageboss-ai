"""Condition rounds — the arriving sheet (LP-905, spec §6).

A thin boundary, as every router in this repo is: validate the edges, hand the work to
`app/services/condition_rounds.py`, enqueue the read, answer. The PDF is parsed by a Celery task
rather than in the request, which is the opposite of the MISMO import — MISMO is fast deterministic
lxml work, while reading a condition sheet rasterises pages and may call a model, so holding the
request open across it would block a worker on a lender's page count.

⚠️ 202, NOT 201, AND THE ROUND COMES BACK IMMEDIATELY. The processor sees the round in `PARSING`
(screen S1-02, "Reading…") and the UI polls it to `DRAFT` or `PARSE_FAILED`. Answering only when the
parse finished would make a slow lender's PDF look like a broken upload.

`company_id` is always the authenticated user's, never the body — and the loan file is loaded
scoped, so a round can only ever be opened on a file the caller's company owns.

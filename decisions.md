# Architecture Decision Record (ADR) Log

This file is a lightweight Architecture Decision Record log for the MortgageBoss
AI V1 build. It captures the significant technical and structural decisions made
during development, so that the reasoning behind them is preserved for future
contributors (and our future selves).

## Format

Each decision is recorded as an entry with the following structure:

- **ADR-NNN: Title** — a short, descriptive title.
- **Date** — when the decision was made.
- **Status** — Proposed | Accepted | Superseded.
- **Context** — the situation and forces that led to the decision.
- **Decision** — what was decided.
- **Consequences** — the resulting trade-offs, both positive and negative.

## ADR-001: Use a monorepo for V1

- **Date:** 2026-06-09
- **Status:** Accepted

**Context:** V1 consists of a Python/FastAPI backend and a Next.js/TypeScript
frontend that are developed in lockstep by a small team (effectively a solo
developer for now). We need to decide whether to keep these in a single
repository or split them into separate repositories.

**Decision:** Use a single monorepo containing both the backend (`backend/`) and
the frontend (`frontend/`), along with shared documentation, scripts, and CI
configuration.

**Consequences:**

- _Positive:_ A single source of truth simplifies cross-cutting changes (e.g.,
  an API contract change that touches both backend and frontend can land in one
  commit/PR). One clone, one set of issues, one CI pipeline, and shared docs and
  decision log. This is simpler to manage for a solo developer.
- _Positive:_ Atomic commits keep backend and frontend in sync, avoiding
  version-mismatch drift between separate repos.
- _Negative:_ The repository mixes two toolchains (uv/Python and pnpm/Node),
  which requires path-scoped tooling and CI jobs.
- _Reversible:_ If the project grows and the boundaries harden, the `backend/`
  and `frontend/` directories can be split into separate repositories later with
  history preserved via `git subtree`/`filter-repo`.
